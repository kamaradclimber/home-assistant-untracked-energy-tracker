# Untracked Energy Tracker for home-assistant

This integration adds a sensor to track energy consumed by the house without being tracked by an individual sensor.
It allows to see what is *missing* and could measured.

⚠️ This integration can be replaced by the feature in upstream HA since [2024.9](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/09/04/release-20249/#tracking-your-untracked-energy) version.
This integration is now obsolete and will not be maintained.
